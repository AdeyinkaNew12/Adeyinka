    "# Accessing weather model data\n",
    "RAiDER has built-in support for a number of different weather models. In addition, RAiDER provides functionality for adding additional weather models as users have need. RAiDER provides all of the interfacing to data servers required to access data for the different weather models, although some weather models require a license agreement. Instructions for accessing data, including license-limited data, are provided below. It is the user's responsibility to accept license agreements for whatever model is desired. \n",

If you are unable to download products, ensure that you have registered and have downloaded the public API key, and accepted/added the license/application for type of product you wish to download as detailed below. \n",

However a public __[archive](home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/hrrr_FAQ.html)__ is available at the University of Utah. This archive does not require a license agreement.

    "The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (__[ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/)__) provides a number of different weather models, including both reanalysis and real-time models.

ECMWF models are global, with horizontal resolution of about 30 km for ERA-I, ERA-5, and ERA-5T, and 6 km for Hi-RES. All of these models come in a global projection (EPSG 4326, WGS-84). \n",
