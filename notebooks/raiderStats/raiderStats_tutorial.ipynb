    "# Peform statistical analyses of GNSS station locations and tropospheric zenith delays\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Simran Sangha, David Bekaert - Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of the functionality included in the **`raiderStats.py`** program. Specifically, we outline examples on how to perform basic statistical analyses of GNSS station location and tropospheric zenith delay information over a user defined area of interest, span of time, and seasonal interval. In this notebook, we query GNSS stations spanning California between 2016 and 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will outline the following statistical analysis and filtering options:\n",
    "- Restrict analyses to range of years\n",
    "- Restrict analyses to range of months (i.e. seasonal interval)\n",
    "- Illustrate station distribution and tropospheric zenith delay mean/standard deviation\n",
    "- Illustrate gridded distribution and tropospheric zenith delay mean/standard deviation\n",
    "- Generate variogram plots across specified time periods\n",
    "- Perform basic seasonal amplitude/phase analyses\n",
    "- Examine residuals between weather-models and collocated GNSS stations\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "Both the initial setup (<b>Prep A</b> section) and download of the data (<b>Prep B</b> section) should be run at the start of the notebook. All other sections (examples and applications) do not need to be run in order.\n",

    "- RAiDER needs to be installed to run this notebook\n",
    "- Most of the examples below specify the use of all available cpus `--cpus all`. If you anticipate this would be an issue on your machine, please adjust to a more conservative number accordingly (e.g. `--cpus 8`).\n",
    "- Just note that downloading data with less than 8 cpus may be very time-consuming and not recommended, while most other steps should run quickly.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- *GNSS*: Stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. Describes any satellite constellation providing global or regional positioning, navigation, and timing services.\n",
    "- *tropospheric zenith delay*: The precise atmospheric delay satellite signals experience when propagating through the troposphere.\n",
    "- *variogram*: Characterization of the difference between field values at two locations.\n",
    "- *empirical variogram / semivariance*: Provides a description of how the data are correlated with distance. 1/2 * sqrt(obs1 - obs2)\n",
    "- *experimental variogram*: A discrete function calculated using a measure of variability between pairs of points at various distances.\n",
    "- *sill/variance*: The limit of the variogram representing where the variogram appears to level off, tending to infinity lag distances.\n",
    "- *range*: The distance in which the difference of the variogram from the sill becomes negligible, such that the data are no longer autocorrelated.\n",

Before variogram fitting, the data across each grid-cell is detrended using a linear ramp derived from a least-squares solution.\n",

    "The empirical variogram is then binned into increments of 20, with the top 3rd percentile discarded. These parameters are *hardcoded*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the experimental variogram is derived using the binned variogram above as input and utilizing an exponential model fit by default (*hardcoded*). The experimental variogram practically is a discrete function calculated using a measure of variability between pairs of points at various distances. **Note** toggling the `--binnedvariogram` option would lead to the an experimental variogram fit to every binned time-slice for a given grid-cell, whereas the default is to bin all data across all time-slices and then fit the experimental variogram for a given grid-cell\n",
    "\n",
    "From this procedure, we derive and plot the output sill/variance and range values. Respectively, the sill/variance represents the limit of the variogram representing where the variogram appears to level off. And the range represents the distance in which the difference of the variogram from the sill becomes negligible, and should not exceed half the size of a given grid-cell."
